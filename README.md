## Introduction
To program for vex robotics we will be using VEXcode Pro V5 which includes both IDE and compiler. The code written in VEXcode Pro V5 is in C/C++ with libraries provided with to control the various VEX components. Programming typically involves in making a driver and autonomous routines.

## Requirements
- VEX V5 Brain
- VEX V5 Controller
- VEX V5 Cables
- VEX V5 Motors
- Various Vex Sensors
- If on **Windows** or **Mac**
  - use this link and download [VEXcode Pro V5](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-download?q=&locale.name=English)
  - use this link for VEXcode Pro V5 [documentation](https://api.vexcode.cloud/v5/).
- If on **Linux**
  - use this link [PROS for V5](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/linux.html)
  - Bear in mind this guide is going to be based of the VEXcode V5 library so syntax will be different for PROS.
  - use this link for [documentation](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/api/cpp/index.html).

## Vex V5 Brain
The V5 Brain shown below in **Fig. xx** is where our program is uploaded to and is the microcontroller of our robot. The program can be uploaded via a paired controller or directly by using a micro usb cable. All of the various components such as motors and sensor will be connected to the V5 Brain. 

To pair a controller to a V5 Brain, make sure there is radio module attached to the brain. Then simply take a V5 Smart Cable and attach it to both the controller and the brain
